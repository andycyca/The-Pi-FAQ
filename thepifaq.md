What is this? {-}
=============

> Now including Pi-adjacent questions!

**The $\pi$ FAQ (aka: "Why Pi is not special in the way you think it's
special")** is an archive of *quick answers* to some of the most
infuriating questions asked by people who believe $\pi$ is unique and
special for the wrong reasons.

As is the case with FAQs, this will always be marked as being a "Work In
Progress". Andycyca welcomes any and all additions you may have to this
list, but please bear in mind that this is not intended to be neither
math-heavy nor citations-heavy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is $\pi$ random?
================

-   **No it's not.** If you and I set to calculate $\pi$ we should
    arrive at the exact same result, digit for digit.
-   **No it's not.** If you calculate $\pi$ today and you calculate it
    tomorrow, you should arrive at the exact same result both days.

What you *probably* mean is that there's no regular [pattern] to the
digits of $\pi$ in decimal notation.

What you *probably* mean is that the decimals of $\pi$ do pass tests of
[statistical randomness]

What you *probably* mean is that $\pi$ is a normal number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is $\pi$ infinite?
==================

-   **No it's not.** There's at least one number that is *finite* and
    larger than $\pi$, namely 4.
-   **No it's not.** There are may finite numbers larger than $\pi$.

What you *probably* mean is that you cannot write $\pi$ *exactly* with a
finite string of digits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do the digits of $\pi$ digits go on forever?
============================================

-   **Yes, but it's not the only one.** Every real number can be written
    with an infinite string of digits. For instance, the number 1 can be
    written like this: $1.000000...$ where there's an infinite string of
    zeroes after the decimal point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can we be sure that the digits of $\pi$ go on forever?
==========================================================

-   [Smart people figured it out long ago]. If you're not prepared or
    willing to take my word, do try to read these proofs (they are
    scattered around the internet and calculus books) and try and
    disprove them. Most---if not all---mathematicians don't bother
    themselves with trying to disprove this fact for anything other than
    amusement.
-   In general, the proof(s) work by *reductio ad absurdum*:
    -   Let's assume $\pi$ is rational;

    -   Rational numbers should have this or that property;

    -   $\pi$ doesn't have that property;

    -   $\therefore$ Therefore, $\pi$ is not rational.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can we be sure that $\pi$ is transcendental?
================================================

-   [Other smart people figured it out long ago]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is $\pi$ irrational?
====================

-   **Yes it is,** but it's far from being unique. Most real numbers are
    [irrational].

What this means is that $\pi$ cannot be expressed as a [fraction] of two
integers. Some numbers have digits that go on forever but are rational,
like $0.333... = 1/3$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that $\pi$ has no exact value?
=========================================

-   **No it's not.** The value of $\pi$ is exact, but we cannot write it
    down *exactly*. We use approximations like $3.14$ and $22/7$, those
    are not exact.
-   **No it's not.** The value of $\pi$ is exact, but the decimal
    *representation* of that value will always be inexact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that $\pi$ is not defined?
=====================================

-   **No it's not.** The value of $\pi$ is unique and well-defined. In
    other words, there's no ambiguity as to what the value of $\pi$ is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it impossible to know the "real" value of $\pi$?
===================================================

-   **No it's not.** There are ways to calculate $\pi$ to any arbitrary
    accuracy. This means that $\pi$ is a *[computable number]*.
-   **No it's not.** $\pi$ can be calculated to any arbitrary precision
    through the use of infinite sums.
-   **No it's not.** Wikipedia has a page on [Pi algorithms], take your
    pick.
-   **No it's not and it matters little for practical uses.** There are
    many [approximations of $\pi$]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that I can calculate $\pi$ with ruled paper and toothpicks?
======================================================================

-   **Sure it is!** [Knock yourself out]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that my name is somewhere in the digits of $\pi$?
============================================================

Is it true that my phone number is somewhere in the digits of $\pi$?
====================================================================

Is it true that the complete works of (your favorite author) are somewhere in the digits of $\pi$?
==================================================================================================

-   **Most likely yes,** but it's not thoroughly proven.
-   **Most likely yes,** but $\pi$ is not unique in this regard.
-   **Most likely yes,** but this is true of most real numbers.

All of these questions hinge on whether $\pi$ is *normal* (and on how
exactly you "translate" from letters to numbers, but that's relatively
easy to do in a number of ways)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that there are six nines in a row somewhere in $\pi$?
================================================================

-   **Yes and it's a coincidence.** It's famous enough to have it's own
    folklore ([some people call it the "Feynman point"])

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is $\pi$ a normal number?
=========================

-   **We don't know for certain.**
-   **Most likely yes,** because almost all real numbers are
    *[normal][computable number]*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a normal number?
========================

-   **Naive definition:** A simple, somewhat naive definition is a
    number that contains all finite sequence of digits in its decimal
    expansion.
-   **A less informal---but still incomplete---definition:** In a
    [normal number][computable number]'s decimal expansion, all 1-digit
    strings are found with 10% probability each, and all 2-digit strings
    with 1% probability each, and 3-digit strings with 0.1% probability
    each... In other words, in a normal number all finite strings of
    length $n$ are found with probability $10^{-n}$ (so in theory the
    numbers $000$ to $999$ happen with $1/1000$ probability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's useless to calculate (whatever number) of digits of $\pi$
==============================================================

-   **No it's not.** Calculating numbers like $\pi$ to a certain
    precision is a way to benchmark computers and algorithms.
-   **No it's not.** Repeating the results of someone else can serve as
    a learning exercise.
-   **No it's not.** It's fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about that law stating that $\pi = 3.2$?
=============================================

Didn't the State of Indiana ruled on the value of $\pi$?
========================================================

-   **Despite what some Lawyers would like to believe, mathematical
    truth cannot be established by legislative attempts.** Law doesn't
    work that way. I know at least one Lawyer that is still bitter about
    being mathematically bullied in High School, a similar sentiment
    might be what prompts some people to think this way.

-   It was only a bill, written by a person sometimes cited as a
    "crank". As mentioned [in other discussions of this case][]:

    > (...) it seems clear to me that the author's model of the world
    > had more deviations from reality than the value of pi.

-   It wasn't *really* about defining the value of $\pi$, rather a
    proposed way of [squaring the circle], a problem stated by ancient
    geometers who didn't have internet. We now know that solving that
    problem *as stated* is impossible.

-   In retrospect, the bill has been a net negative for the State of
    Indiana, given that it's been a source for cheap laughs in the best
    cases, and a source for bad journalists to spin mediocre articles in
    the worst.

No.Â 246 Revisited]". Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science.
**84**: 376--399.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it true that the Hebrew Bible establishes $\pi$ equals three?
================================================================

-   **Not really.** [It's complicated].
-   Could be an error in measuring inner and outer rims of a large basin
    known as the [Molten Sea or Brazen Sea]
-   Determining $\pi$ from physical measurements is always sure to be an
    approximation at best.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Pilish?
===============

-   [Pilish] is a style of constrained writing in which the lengths of
    consecutive words match the digits of the number $\pi$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Piphilology?
====================

-   The study (?) of [creating mnemonic devices to memorize the digits
    of $\pi$].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's this poem that encodes the digits of $\pi$
==================================================

-   [There's many]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's this novel that encodes the digits of $\pi$
===================================================

-   [Cadaeic Cadenza] encodes 3,835 digits.
-   [Not a Wake] encodes 10,000 digits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's this movie...
=====================

-   ...[directed by Darren Aronofsky]. I know it. I've seen it. I like
    it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the movie $\pi$...
=====================

-   ...yes, the value at the beginning of the movie only has 8 digits
    "right" after the decimal point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is 748/238?
================

-   $748 / 238$ simplifies to $22/7 = 3.14285714286$
-   A funny reference at the end of Aronofsky's movie titled "$\pi$"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common misconceptions surrounding $\pi$ and other numbers
=========================================================

$\pi$ is a special number because...
====================================

> (Hint: some of these also apply to that other number $\phi$)

All of these are **false** (or misleading):

-   A number and its representation (usually in decimal) are the same
    thing.
    -   Our way of writing down numbers has some bugs, and it breaks
        down sometimes. It happens.
-   There is only one way to write down the same number in decimal
    positional system.
    -   This is why lots of people get confused about $1 = 0.999999...$
        Both are the same number, written in two possible ways.
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because its digits go on forever.
    -   All real numbers can be expressed with an infinite number of
        decimals (although many of them can be zeroes)
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because its digits never repeat.
    -   This is a feature of irrational numbers, which greatly outnumber
        the rational numbers.
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because its digits contain (your phone
    number/the name of your one true love/the secret recipe for KFC's
    herb and spices mix)
    -   This is a feature of normal numbers, which greatly outnumber the
        non-normal numbers.
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because it can be calculated with a
    never-ending series of nested fractions.
    -   This is a feature of irrational numbers, which greatly outnumber
        the rational numbers. All irrationals can be written down as
        continued fractions.
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because it's not the root of any "nice"
    polynomials.
    -   This is a feature of transcendental numbers, which greatly
        outnumber the algebraic numbers (even though we only have
        identified a small batch of them)
-   $\pi$ is somehow special because...
    -   Ask yourself first: does that property also apply to $\pi + 1$?
        Does that property also apply to $\pi + 2$? Because it's very
        likely there's an infinite series of numbers that share that
        "special property". $\pi$ is not special because of these silly
        reasons.

What is $\tau$?

I think $\tau$ is better
========================

No u

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collection of stupid questions that should not be asked if the above FAQ has been read
========================================================================================

All of these I've found on the internet. Save for correcting the
occasional typo, I present them *verbatim*, as someone else typed it.

-   Could Pi Be Finite?
-   Why is Pi infinite when you can just work it out exactly to 3
    decimal places?
-   Why is pi not infinite?
